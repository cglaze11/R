# the connect between mutiple tables
# this charpter is the same as proc sql in SAS,
# 1.mutate joins
#     -inner join
#     -outer join
#         -left join 
#         -right join
#         -full join
#     -key
#         -three kands of key format
# 2.filter joins
#     -semi_join
#     -anti_join
# the difference between filter joins and mutate joins is without duplicate observises.
# 3.joins problems
#     -Start by identifying the variables that form the primary key in each table while understanding the real mean of the variable
#     -Check that none of the variables in the primary key are missing. If a value is missing then it canâ€™t identify an observation!
#     -Check that your foreign keys match primary keys in another table. The best way to do this is with an anti_join().
# 4.set operations
      # -intersect(x, y): return only observations in both x and y.
      # -union(x, y): return unique observations in x and y.
      # -setdiff(x, y): return observations in x, but not in y.

# Filtering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

# Set operations, which treat observations as if they were set elements.


# keys
# A primary key uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. 

# A foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another table. 

# a surrogate key : add one with mutate() and row_number()
