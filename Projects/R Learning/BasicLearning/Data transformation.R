# Pick observations by their values (filter()).
# Reorder the rows (arrange()).
# Pick variables by their names (select()).
# Create new variables with functions of existing variables (mutate()).
# Collapse many values down to a single summary (summarise()).
# These can all be used in conjunction with group_by() which changes the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset 
#   to operating on it group-by-group.

# Find all flights that

    filter(flights, dep_delay >= 120)
#   Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

#   Were operated by United, American, or Delta
    # filter(flights, dest %in% c('IAH','HOU'))
#   Departed in summer (July, August, and September)
    
#   Arrived more than two hours late, but didnâ€™t leave late
#   Were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight
#   Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)
#   Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between(). What does it do? 
#       Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?
#   How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
#   Why is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing? Why is FALSE & NA not missing?
#         Can you figure out the general rule? (NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)
